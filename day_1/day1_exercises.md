1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
  - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
  - HTML tag starts with < and ends with >
  - Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML elements
3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
  - Attributes provide additional information about elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value". For example, the <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. < a href= "https: //www.w3schools.com" > Visit W3Schools </a >
4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  - The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
  - The <title> HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text.
  - The <body> tag defines the document's body. The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document.
5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
  - Right-click the page and click on “View Page Source,” or press Ctrl + U, to see the page's source in a new tab. A new tab opens along with all the HTML for the webpage, completely expanded and unformatted.
6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
  1. h1, h2, h3, h4 elements represent levels of section headings.
  2. div container for flow content. Has no effect on the content or layout using CSS.
  3. ul represents an unordered list
  8. button a clickable button used to submit forms
  1. img embeds an image into the document
7.  What are empty elements?
  - Empty elements have no content (like the br element). They do not have an end tag.
8.  What is semantic markup?
  - Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.
9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
  - header, footer, section, article, figure and figcaption
